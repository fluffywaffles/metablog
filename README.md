# The simplest blog generator.

* Has no features.
* Compiles fast.
* Doesn't give a crap.

## Run it.

Edit the templates in `template/` if you want to change them.

Make a file in `page/` for each page of your blog.

Run the following command at your prompt:

```
$ node --harmony metablog.js
```

Now your generated blog pages are in `dist/`.
